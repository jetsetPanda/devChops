Soft skills can be the deciding factor between you and another candidate getting the job. No hiring manager is ever going to directly ask you about soft skills in an interview, so it’s entirely up to you to showcase them. The secret is to talk about your soft skills as part of how you answer the interview questions. It’s a matter of explaining your answers with a ‘how’ statement, rather than just talking about a result.
Below are seven of the most in-demand soft skills, and ways that you can demonstrate each one.

Perseverance and dedication.
Perseverance and dedication represent your work ethic, and both of these skills are invaluable to employers. These are skills that are more inherent rather than taught, which is why they’re regarded so highly. Highlight your perseverance and dedication when talking about your accomplishments, job responsibilities, and answering the ‘why do you want to work here?’ question. You can also showcase your perseverance when talking about problem solving, as these skills go hand in hand.

Problem solving.
Problem solving skills are easily demonstrated throughout the entire interview. One standout place where you can highlight your problem solving abilities is when you’re asked to describe a past accomplishment. Rather than just saying what you did, describe how you did it. Outline the steps you took to reach the end result. You can talk about how you overcame obstacles along the way to success or how you found a solution by addressing challenges as they came up.

Teamwork and collaboration.
Teamwork and collaboration are important parts of any job, regardless of the position you’re interviewing for. To showcase your teamwork and collaboration skills, avoid making too many ‘I’ statements and replace them with ‘we’. When you’re talking about your accomplishments, be sure to mention how you collaborated with your colleagues or played a role as part of a team.

Adaptability.
Being able to adapt to different situations is a key skill in the workplace, which makes adaptability one of the most frequently used soft skills. There will always be times that you need to step outside your typical responsibilities. This can range from pitching in on a project to taking over if a colleague quits unexpectedly. One surefire place to showcase your adaptability is when you’re talking about your previous job responsibilities. You can describe a time that you went above and beyond your daily work or how you stepped in to help when you noticed someone needed help.

Creativity.
Creativity is finding a unique solution to a problem. It’s approaching something from a different angle. It's innovation and diversity in thinking. It’s a part of so many aspects of work, from problem solving to communication, leadership, and so much more. Creativity can be a bit more challenging to showcase, especially when you’re in a technical or administrative role, but it’s not as difficult as you might think.

Time management.
Time management is a critical skill for every employee to have, regardless of job or title. To showcase your time management skills, talk about how you were able to stay on track with a deadline or how you created a timeline to keep a project on track. Never say outright that you’re good at time management, prove it instead.

​​Persuasion.
This is the easiest skill of all to demonstrate – your role in an interview is to persuade the interviewer to hire you! Demonstrate your persuasion skills by clearly stating and elaborating on your answers. Use persuasion along with your communication skills to showcase why you’re the right candidate for the job.

All of these skills are actually related to each other, so you should find yourself describing them multiple times throughout your interview, and not always exclusively. Remember to clarify your answers with a ‘how’ statement, which allows you to talk about things in more detail.
